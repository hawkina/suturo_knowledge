# suturo_knowledge

The SUTURO Knowledge stack is based on [KnowRob](https://github.com/SUTURO/knowrob/tree/neems), a knowledge processing system, which provides functionalities to represent knowledge and reasoning methods. We are using it to store, represent and infer rich information about the robots state and its environment.

## Getting started

### Installation guide
Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/SUTURO/knowrob/tree/neems) to set up the SUTURO Knowledge system on your computer.  
_TODO: Provide updated installation guide_

- **Visual Studio Code**  
  Install the [`VSC-Prolog`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arthurwang.vsc-prolog) extension to get syntax highlighting and code completion for Prolog in VS Code.

## running
just roslaunch suturo knowledge by calling:
```
roslaunch suturo_knowledge suturo_knowledge.launch
```
If you see *rosprolog service is running* it seemed to work and all is good. :)
